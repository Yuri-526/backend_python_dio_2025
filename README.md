# CONTEXT:

<p>I began a new backend development course on DIO platform and, as you can imagine, 
I am learning python, of course (again, from the scratch). This repository is
used to stash the projects (A.K.A practical challenges).</p>

# Projects 

### 1. Basic ATM Machine

<p>The script must simulate three ATM machine functions,
namely check balance, deposit and withdraw. As a starting point, 
the platform released a code template (Yeah, I know... please don't hate me.)
Check reference [1] for more details.</p>

### 2. ATM Machine Refactoring

<p> As you can imagine, and to absolutely no one's surprise, project two is a 
refactoring of project one, with the addition of the following functions: 
register user, create new account for registered users and list all registered accounts.</p>
